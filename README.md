<p class="MsoNormal">“Anyone between the ages of 21 and 85 who has a little
unpredictable blood sugar to those with more serious blood sugar problems can
benefit from this approach.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">After following the routine and avoiding the medicine provided by your doctor to manage your diabetes, you may be able to quit taking "painful, scary insulin shots" and "side-effect-filled prescriptions," according to Sonu's Diabetes Secret.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br /></p><p class="MsoNormal">“This natural cure may be able to reduce the need for painful, scary insulin needles, side-effect-laden pharmaceuticals, and harsh dietary restrictions that have turned dining into a work... rather than something we should enjoy.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">In fact, the writers of Sonu's Diabetic Secret believe that while prescription diabetes medications don't work for many people, natural foods available at your local grocery do. You can target your diabetes and get relief by making dietary modifications and eating more of these specific foods.</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yYiHvy2gKLM/YU4clnLs0LI/AAAAAAAADJY/V_ljkUr8LZoYEGx4uWlPxr7F00ecRhKYwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1280/25468908_web1_M-ADW-20210611-What-is-Sonu_s-Diabetes-Secret.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="322" data-original-width="1280" height="141" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yYiHvy2gKLM/YU4clnLs0LI/AAAAAAAADJY/V_ljkUr8LZoYEGx4uWlPxr7F00ecRhKYwCLcBGAsYHQ/w557-h141/25468908_web1_M-ADW-20210611-What-is-Sonu_s-Diabetes-Secret.jpeg" width="557" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><p></p><h2 style="background-color: #fefefe; box-sizing: inherit; color: #312c2d; font-family: &quot;Source Serif Pro&quot;, Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 2.5rem; line-height: 1.166; margin: 0px 0px 0.5rem; padding: 0px; text-rendering: optimizelegibility;">The Story Behind Sonu’s Diabetes Secret</h2><div><div>Karen Richardson, <a href="https://9a7afkr6gjjn7k4f0iurmhg91j.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=GITHUB" target="_blank">Sonu's Diabetes Secret's</a> creator, is a woman. Karen is a single mother of two children and a middle school math teacher. She was baking chocolate chip cookies for her grandson at 8 p.m. one night. She began to feel lightheaded and disoriented before collapsing.</div><div><br /></div><div>Karen had a stroke in the hospital, and doctors said she was lucky she didn't die. Karen's blood sugar was a little high, with a fasting blood sugar of 147 and an A1C of 7.2, according to the doctors. A stroke could have been caused by this elevated blood sugar.</div><div>Karen's doctor prescribed metformin to help her control her condition and lower her blood sugar. Karen's metformin side effects were so severe that doctors advised her to take two pills.</div></div><div><div>To deal with the negative effects, more prescription medicines are needed. Karen was also instructed by her doctors that she needed to start taking insulin injections, reduce weight, and meet with a dietitian and nutritionist to learn how to eat healthier.</div><div><br /></div><div>Karen, on the other hand, was dissatisfied with the registered dietitian and nutritionist's food recommendations. She was adamant about not giving up junk food. She wished to keep eating the meals she enjoyed:</div><div><br /></div><div>“However, after meeting them, I was devastated because they wanted me to eat and exercise like a 21-year-old fitness model who had a little appetite, a fast metabolism, was wealthy, and didn't have a hectic life!... I couldn't eat any of my favorite foods. I couldn't eat any carbohydrates or sugar. I had to eat like a bird and work out like a madman. What a prank!”</div><div>Karen began looking for natural diabetic solutions after becoming frustrated with the nutritional and medical guidance.</div></div><div><br /></div><div><h2 style="background-color: #fefefe; box-sizing: inherit; color: #312c2d; font-family: &quot;Source Serif Pro&quot;, Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 2.5rem; line-height: 1.166; margin: 0px 0px 0.5rem; padding: 0px; text-rendering: optimizelegibility;">Karen Discovers a Small Asian Country with Low Rates of Diabetes</h2></div><div><div>Karen came upon a <a href="https://9a7afkr6gjjn7k4f0iurmhg91j.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=GITHUB" target="_blank">National Geographic program</a> while looking for natural diabetic solutions. That documentary cited a small Asian country with low diabetes and blood sugar rates:</div><div><br /></div><div>“Had these guys discovered what I refer to as the “ultimate blood sugar cure”? I was eager to learn more, so I began paying close attention and taking notes right away. FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS, THESE PEOPLE HAD LOW RATES OF TYPE 2 DIABETES NATURALLY! And the best part was that they continued to eat the meals they enjoyed.”</div><div>Karen was so taken with the country that she scheduled a trip to the little Asian country right away. She met a "sensei" named Sonu in that nation.</div></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div><p class="MsoNormal">Because “my ancestors found this treatment over 200 years ago,” Sonu told Karen, people eat a lot of carbs and sugar but have low rates of diabetes. He further asserts that the local food is strong in fats and sugars and that the people "live like kings and queens."</p><p class="MsoNormal">Diabetes and high blood sugar problems, according to Sonu, are caused by "blood sugar inflammation." Sonu believes that by treating blood sugar inflammation, “your blood sugar problems would be relieved.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Sonu suggests consuming certain foods to reduce blood sugar inflammation. These foods can help to reduce inflammation caused by blood sugar. Targeting blood sugar inflammation, according to Sonu, “keeps our blood sugar levels in the healthy range.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">Sonu suggested a sweet berry that, according to him, “filters out much of the sugar from the carbs and sugar you eat,” allowing you to eat sugary, sweet, carb-heavy dishes guilt-free. White mulberry is the berry in question.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Sonu suggested white mulberry, yogurt, and other natural foods, which you can learn about in Sonu's Diabetes Secret.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-a9-ynPeGi68/YU4fctNxjxI/AAAAAAAADJg/jG57K_nTLz0F8-EVXV0Hhv-__c0Sty_OwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1280/25468908_web1_M-ADW-20210611-Whats-Sonus-secret.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="322" data-original-width="1280" height="142" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-a9-ynPeGi68/YU4fctNxjxI/AAAAAAAADJg/jG57K_nTLz0F8-EVXV0Hhv-__c0Sty_OwCLcBGAsYHQ/w561-h142/25468908_web1_M-ADW-20210611-Whats-Sonus-secret.jpeg" width="561" /></a></div><br /><h2 style="background-color: #fefefe; box-sizing: inherit; color: #312c2d; font-family: &quot;Source Serif Pro&quot;, Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 2.5rem; line-height: 1.166; margin: 0px 0px 0.5rem; padding: 0px; text-rendering: optimizelegibility;">What Happened After Karen Implemented the Healthy Blood Sugar Foods?</h2><div><div>Karen incorporated Sonu's advised blood sugar meals into her diet after returning from Asia.
